# Ben's Bio
Welcome to my personal GitHub.io page! This is where I will be displaying my works for COMM 165: Data Storytelling.

In the future, after the course is finished, I plan on migrating my works into their own tab on my page.
This will give me room to highlight works that may not be directly related to this course.

## About me
My name is Benjamin Aulenbach and I am headed into my senior year at Lehigh University. I have a wide variety of interests both related and unreleated to academics.
Some of my academic interests include all things computers. I love tinkering around with hardware, as well as diving into the software and figuring out how things work.
I am also very interested in cryptocurrencies, which is what I plan on focusing a lot of my research during my COMM 165 course. I am hoping to unearth discoveries that can provide valuable insights into the crypto space, potentially helping the average person on their journey with crypto.
Some non-academic interests include chess and science fiction, both books and movies. I love getting absorbed into a different world and suspending reality for a time. One of my favorite series is the Kingkiller Chronicle, by Patrick Rothfuss. I'm anxiously awaiting Doors of Stone!!

I also have interests in photography and videography. I created a website (aulenbachaesthetics.com) that will host some of my favorite shots and films, but it is still in the early stages. I hope to organize it and upload more content in the near future. But in the meantime, below I've included a couple pictures of the best two pups in the history of puppers: Blizzard and Frosty.
