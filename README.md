# Ben's Bio
Welcome to my personal GitHub.io page! This is where I will be displaying my works for COMM 165: Data Storytelling.

In the future, after the course is finished, I plan on migrating my works into their own tab on my page.
This will give me room to highlight works that may not be directly related to this course.
<br/><br/>

## About me
My name is Benjamin Aulenbach and I am headed into my senior year at Lehigh University. I have a wide variety of interests both related and unreleated to academics.
Some of my academic interests include everything about computers. I love tinkering around with hardware, as well as diving into the software and figuring out how things work.
I am also very interested in cryptocurrencies, which is where I am focusing a lot of my research during the COMM 165 course. I am hoping to unearth discoveries that can provide valuable insights into the crypto space, potentially helping the average person on their journey with crypto.
Some non-academic interests include chess and science fiction, both books and movies. I love getting absorbed into a different world and suspending reality for a time. One of my favorite series is the Kingkiller Chronicle, by Patrick Rothfuss. I'm anxiously awaiting Doors of Stone!!

I also have interests in photography and videography. I created a website [Aulenbach Aesthetics](https://www.aulenbachaesthetics.com) that will host some of my favorite shots and films, but it is still in the early stages. I hope to organize it and upload more content in the near future. But in the meantime, I've included below a couple pictures of the best two pups in the history of puppers: Blizzard and Frosty.

## Portfolio
*Over my time taking COMM 165: Data Storytelling, I was able to learn various tools such as Datawrapper, ParseHub, ThingLink, and more. I utilized the Twitter API to collect Tweets and respective metadata to create a heatmap of Bitcoin related tweets. After a couple starter assignments, where I utilized Lehigh University's enrollment data, I began to focus my efforts on my current pashion: cryptocurrency. I set a goal for myself to try and understand the rates of Bitcoin adoption across the world. More specifically, I wanted to determine the differences betweeen race, economic status, education level, and a variety of other factors. Finding relevant datasets surrounding these ideas was quite challenging and I was unsuccessful in these pursuits. While I was unable to accomplish my lofty project goal due to time constraints (I took this course in six weeks while working a full-time internship), I hope to find time in the future to explore related datasets surrounding these important issues.*

### Lehigh Enrollment 2020 (Pie Charts)
*This interactive chart was created utilizing Datawrapper, an online charting tool. If you hover over various slices of the pie chart, the respective label will be highlighted on the other pies and legend to the right. By analyzing this chart, it can be determined that females tend to have higher rates of Arts and Science majors, while males tend to have higher rates of Engineering majors. In the "Total" pie, it can be seen that Arts and Science majors are more common overall, even though Lehigh was originally and engineering institution.*

### Lehigh Enrollment 2020 (Bar Chart)
*Similar to the chart above, this bar chart also shows the breakdown of Lehigh's Enrollment in 2020. This chart does not break down by gender, but instead shows the total headcount of all students. Again, it is evident that Arts and Sciences is the most popular major group, followed by Engineering with 476 fewer students. As a horizontal bar chart, it is only practical to have one breakdown in this chart. A vertical bar chart would be more suited to a breakdown by gender as seen in the pie chart.*

### Lehigh Enrollment 2010-2021
*This line chart allows for a different analysis compared to the previous charts. Since there is a range of years included in the data, the change in enrollmenmt year over year can be analyzed. Due to the charts interactive nature, the audience can hover over specific points on the chart and visualize the exact numbers for each data point. Just as with a lot of other Universities, Lehigh's enrollment dropped of during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.*

### Historical Cryptocurrency Data (2013-2018)
*This logorithmic line chart shows the price of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC) from 2013 to 2018. The dataset used stopped at 2018, but I would have liked to visualize at least to early 2021. In the future I plan on updating this chart to visualize all historical data from Bitcoin's creation in 2009, all the way to the present day. The chart below shows the strong correlation between BTC, ETH, and LTC. Notice how when Ethereum was created mid 2015, it quickly rose and began its strong BTC/ETH correlation early 2016. Notice how LTC stays fairly stagnant from Spetember 2015 to April 2017, potentially due to the introduction of Ethereum to the crypto space. 2017 saw a strong bull run seen across all three currencies, followed by the sharp sell-off early 2018. Remember this chart is logorithmic, so the peak seen around late 2017/early 2018 has siginificant price volatility.

### Map of #Bitcoin Tweets
*This heat map shows the rates of tweets with the hashtag "#Bitcoin" in and around Pennsylvania. As an interactive map, the audience can zoom in and see a further breakdown by location. Notice the large amount of tweets coming from major metropolitan areas such as Philadelphia and New York City.*

### Volume of Bitcoin Traded vs. Bitcoin Price Volatility
*These interactive bar charts highlight the amount of Bitcoin traded on a daily basis from October 2017 through July 2017, as well as the price volatility during the same time period. It can be seen there is a correlation between the difference in prices on days when the trading volume is higher. This can be utilized by traders and HODLers (people who "hold on for dear life") in order to find good entry points for trades and purchases.*
